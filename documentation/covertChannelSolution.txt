The theme of the website in general is Linux, and anti Windows. The covert channel combines your hatred for Windows
with a covert channel to give a user information in plain sight.

To make use of the covert channel, first navigate to our "Window's Sucks" page using the nav bar at the top of the page.

On this page is 4 images, that has event listeners tied to them, as well as a number.
As each image is pressed, it constructs a sequence list until you reach 6 numbers in the sequence.
If you enter the correct sequence, hidden HTML is sent from the backend server to the frontend to display.

The correct sequence is 1,2,3,4,2,1.
This means you click the penguin with the juice box, the blue screen, the guy with a bat next to window, the penguin at the bottom,
then the blue screen again, and finally the penguin with the juice box at the top.

These sequence of clicks will display secret information to the user. In addition to this, a command is mentioned to the user to use
on our terminal page.

If the user navigates to the terminal page from the nav bar at the top of the page, and enters the command "cowsay", then they
will be given information about API keys for certain servers.
